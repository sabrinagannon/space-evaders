Game for INT D 450

This repo is broken into 3 directories:

CURRENT VERSION contains the most recent copy of the game code, as well as all art and sound assets (in current version/assets)

PREVIOUS VERSIONS contains previous versions of the game code, before major changes (this likely will become obsolete as code becomes increasingly OO but yknow we'll see)

EXAMPLES contains reference code snippets and tutorial work.
